A group of customers and partners at the October 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint came together to discuss Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Salesforce.org ecosystem. Updates on our discussions and efforts will be posted here.

Q: Why was this being discussed at an Open Source Community Sprint? Aren't those events to improve products and documentation for nonprofit and education organizations?

A: Correct, the primary purpose of an Open Source Community Sprint is to improve products. However, many of us have first-hand knowledge of the magic that ensues when mission-focused Trailblazers connect in person. The value produced beyond product improvement is substantial; notably due to the Salesforce.org Sprint team providing one of the safest and welcoming spaces in the ecosystem. Increasing the participation of historically marginalized Black and other Peoples of Color in the Salesforce.org ecosystem is key to people from these communities gaining sustainable careers, building critical interpersonal relationships, and influencing the product development road map.

### 
**Project Vision (Your first task as a team)**

We want to build a Diversity, Equality, Inclusive framework. There was clearly a lack of diversity in the room.


*   Who: People of color who are historically marginalized and are seeking a sustainable career in the Salesforce ecosystem.
*   What: To be invited and on boarded (by Salesforce) into a welcoming space to build deep relationships and navigate the Salesforce ecosystem

### 
**Project Team Accomplishments**

* We identified our target user then identified potential barriers for that person. We then identified outcomes and possible solutions. We decided that we will first focus on the Atlanta Sprint and based on our successes there build out a larger framework for other sprints and Salesforce events.

* We created a V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles and Measures) here https://docs.google.com/document/d/178h7Iua-MCbgxUCh5s2qCYQjCpOESWhMmXY3O7VhEt0/edit?pli=1

* The Sprint team (Cori, Jace, Judi) have updated the Atlanta FAQ, specifically around the “Who Comes to the Sprint” and “How to Prepare for the Sprint” to be more inclusive and clear. 

### 
**Current Work**

* Increase the number of POC sprint attendees at the 2020 Sprints.  
* Identify barriers to participation for our target audience. Those in attendance at the Philadelphia Sprint identified some. We'd like know the barriers from those who want to but can not attend. 
* Work with the Sprint team and Mary Scotton (VP, Trailblazer Equality) to determine what is Sprint work and what is Trailblazer community work and the intersection of the two.
