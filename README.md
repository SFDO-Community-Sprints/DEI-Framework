### History

A group of customers and partners at the October 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint came together to discuss Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Salesforce.org ecosystem. Updates on our discussions and efforts will be posted here.

Q: Why was this being discussed at an Open Source Community Sprint? Aren't those events to improve products and documentation for nonprofit and education organizations?

A: Correct, the primary purpose of an Open Source Community Sprint is to improve products. However, many of us have first-hand knowledge of the magic that ensues when mission-focused Trailblazers connect in person. The value produced beyond product improvement is substantial; notably due to the Salesforce.org Sprint team providing one of the safest and welcoming spaces in the ecosystem. Increasing the participation of historically marginalized Black and other Peoples of Color in the Salesforce.org ecosystem is key to people from these communities gaining sustainable careers, building critical interpersonal relationships, and influencing the product development road map.

### Project Vision

We want to build a Diversity, Equality, Inclusive framework. There was clearly a lack of diversity in the room.

*   Who: People of color who are historically marginalized and are seeking a sustainable career in the Salesforce ecosystem.
*   What: To be invited and on boarded (by Salesforce) into a welcoming space to build deep relationships and navigate the Salesforce ecosystem

### Project Team Accomplishments (YTD)
When the DEI team formed in 2019, we set out to make Sprint events more diverse and inclusive spaces where talented and driven individuals could thrive regardless of socio-economic background. The urgency of the current moment means it’s all of our responsibility to examine all aspects of our personal and professional lives, including here within the Open Source Commons Community.

We understand that our diversity strengthens us. When people can fully be themselves, reflecting individual and collective experiences, backgrounds, characteristics, and influences, we all benefit. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion work is long term social change work, and it’s first step is understanding what is the current reality and what challenges need our attention now.

During the March 2020 Virtual Sprint, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Sprint Team developed a survey to understand the experiences of those who participated in the Virtual Sprint. The DEI Team has collated the results to make recommendations to the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team on how to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints moving forward.

Key Takeaways

1) Black Sprint participants did not feel represented.
2) Once Black participants were engaged in the Sprint, their experience tracked similarly to the whole group: positively.
3) There was a significant lack of participants who identify as LGBTQ+ and non-binary, non-gender confirming.
4) Sprint participants were overwhelmingly white and female with 32% of participants identifying as straight, white women. 

Based on these data-back takeaways, we recommend the following:

Our findings show that the most effective ways to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints are to:

1) Increase the number of diverse participants at the Sprint
2) Equip and empower diverse participants to get the most out of the Sprint.

We commend the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team for the intention and execution of creating a welcoming and inclusive Virtual Sprint, and we look forward to these recommendations being implemented in future Sprints. Thank you!
