### History

A group of customers and partners at the October 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint came together to discuss Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Salesforce.org ecosystem. Updates on our discussions and efforts will be posted here.

Q: Why was this being discussed at an Open Source Community Sprint? Aren't those events to improve products and documentation for nonprofit and education organizations?

A: Correct, the primary purpose of an Open Source Community Sprint is to improve products. However, many of us have first-hand knowledge of the magic that ensues when mission-focused Trailblazers connect in person. The value produced beyond product improvement is substantial; notably due to the Salesforce.org Sprint team providing one of the safest and welcoming spaces in the ecosystem. Increasing the participation of historically marginalized Black and other Peoples of Color in the Salesforce.org ecosystem is key to people from these communities gaining sustainable careers, building critical interpersonal relationships, and influencing the product development road map.

### Project Vision

We want to build a Diversity, Equality, Inclusive framework. There was clearly a lack of diversity in the room.

*   Who: People of color who are historically marginalized and are seeking a sustainable career in the Salesforce ecosystem.
*   What: To be invited and on boarded (by Salesforce) into a welcoming space to build deep relationships and navigate the Salesforce ecosystem

### Current Project Team Accomplishments


### Project Team Accomplishments (YTD)
* Developed a survey to understand the experiences of those who participated in the Virtual Sprint. The DEI Sprint Team will use this information to make recommendations about marketing and programming for future Sprints.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbmuin4-Tj-KL4gAjECFQzRrIeKe-QZLbbCTZsH37L0y9HcQ/viewform

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)

We will be sending out a survey to those who didn't attend a Sprint and would like as much participation as possible. Watch this space or the Power of Us for the survey and please complete it. 

For future Virtual Sprints, please encourage participation especially to our target population. We are learning that personal invitations are one of the top ways people decide to attend a Sprint. So invite!

**Austin** This is the next in-person Sprint in 2020. We need help in reaching out to our target demographic in Austiin. Start early! If you have connections in Austin, particularly with our target demographic, please reach out to them and personally invite them to the Seattle and Austin Sprints. If you want us to help with the reach out or to follow-up with you please comment in the Power of Us Hub group or contact one of us directly.
