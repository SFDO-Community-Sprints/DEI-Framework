### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Framework

Welcome!

The DEI project is focused on increasing the diversity, equity and inclusion at the Sprints.
This project is for all verticals. Everyone is included!


### Brief History

After noticing a lack of diversity in the room at the 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint, a group of customers and partners formed a project team to address systemic Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion issues within the Salesforce ecosystem/economy. The team set out with the goal to identify, mitigate, and dismantle structural barriers that have barred people from marginalized communities from entry to the Sprint events and the broader Salesforce ecosystem.

### Project Vision

The DEI Team fundamentally believes that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strengthen our community. When the DEI team formed in 2019, we set out to make Sprint events more diverse and inclusive spaces where talented and driven individuals could thrive regardless of socio-economic background. The urgency of the current moment means it’s all of our responsibility to examine all aspects of our personal and professional lives, including here within the Open Source Commons Community.

We understand that our diversity strengthens us. When people can fully be themselves, reflecting individual and collective experiences, backgrounds, characteristics, and influences, we all benefit

### Understanding our current reality and key takeaways
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion work is long term social change work, and it’s first step is understanding what is the current reality and what challenges need our attention now.

During the March 2020 Virtual Sprint, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Sprint Team developed a survey to understand the experiences of those who participated in the Virtual Sprint. The DEI Team has collated the results to make recommendations to the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team on how to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints moving forward. 

[Analysis of Results of March 2020 Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DHMRS7ZV90G5Y544aPm8NyQvjsZyM1Q6/view)

#### Key Takeaways

1) Black Sprint participants did not feel represented.
2) Once Black participants were engaged in the Sprint, their experience tracked similarly to the whole group: positively.
3) There was a significant lack of participants who identify as LGBTQ+ and non-binary, non-gender confirming.
4) Sprint participants were overwhelmingly white and female with 32% of participants identifying as straight, white women. 

#### Recommendations

Our findings show that the most effective ways to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints are to:

1) Increase the number of diverse participants at the Sprint
2) Equip and empower diverse participants to get the most out of the Sprint.

We commend the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team for the intention and execution of creating a welcoming and inclusive Virtual Sprint, and we look forward to these recommendations being implemented in future Sprints. Thank you!

### July 2020 Mini-Sprint
(Link to blog post when it is complete)

The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and the murder of George Floyd exposed the deadly consequences of global systemic racial inequality. From impacted communities reeling from generational trauma to allies feeling overwhelmed and unsure how to respond, the summer of 2020 has been a difficult time for everyone. Responding to the “Current Moment” with Equity and Compassion, the team designed our solutions by centering the needs of historically underserved and marginalized populations and identifying methods that could achieve maximum positive impact with the resources available to us.

The DEI Mini-Sprint was designed around four main themes:

- Intentional transformation: Intentionally transforming the Sprint event into a space where anyone can show up as their fully authentic selves and thrive regardless of their socio-economic status.
- Reimagining what a Sprint project looks like: While most Sprint projects focus on the NPSP and EDA products this project is focused on how we can use the Sprint event to organize Salesforce and its external customers, partners, and consultants to serve the needs of marginalized groups within the Salesforce ecosystem.
- Meeting the demands of the current moment: We all have a part to play in building a more equitable and inclusive society. The DEI team decided to use the mini-sprint as a space where impacted communities and allies can work together to develop and actualize solutions that will lead to a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive Salesforce ecosystem.
- Grounding in Compassion: Understanding that marginalized communities are more impacted by this moment we need to understand their needs so they can feel supported.
Responding to the Current Moment

During the mini-Sprint, 30+ participants broke up into four different working groups to collaborate on the solutions identified by the DEI team:

#### Eco-wide Coalition Building 
Sub-group leader: Emma Bloksberg-Fireovid 

What’s working in the space? What’s not working? Where is our greatest opportunity for impact?  The main pain points we identified were around people getting into hiring pipelines. They’ve skilled up and have some experience but  they’re still not getting that first job.   Employers are struggling without a model and need a blueprint. 

Next steps include mapping out existing DEI groups and convening those leaders and critical actors in positions of influence to build bridges between organizations. 

#### Eco-wide Surveys
Sub-group leader: Charise Van Liew

In order to launch a successful DEI initiative one must understand the current context and experiences of underrepresented groups. This sub-group drafted a survey for the Partner Summit to understand the demographic make up of Salesforce.org Partner organizations. We also discussed next steps for a standing post-Sprint DEI survey. 

Immediate next steps are to finalize and distribute the partner survey. Following the distribution of the partner survey, this group will develop a survey for a broader audience (including outside of the Power of Us Hub) to understand the barriers to underrepresented groups attending the Sprint.


#### 2020 Sprint Planning:
Sub-group leader: Melissa Hill Dees 

The 2020 Sprint Planning team was tasked with DEI related action items for the Sprint planning team to create inclusive programming for upcoming Sprints. The first task in inclusion is to provide a safe environment for diversity to thrive and the code of conduct for Sprints is an important part. Our sub-group researched and drafted the initial version of the code of conduct for upcoming Sprints.

Next steps include a review of the code of conduct by the #SFDOSprint team and including this code of conduct in registration steps for upcoming Sprints. 

#### International Sprint Programming
Sub-group leader: Akash Mishra

Having a voice is important but what matters the most is your voice be heard. Voices are each unique, revealing, and central to your ability to lead change in the world. The prime focus of this group is to ensure that the unheard voice of international sprinters is heard and to help people coming from under-represented regions, like APAC, to feel welcomed at the International sprints. With the Sprint event going completely virtual in 2020, it has a potential opportunity to attract a larger global audience; therefore, this group is inclined to bring up ideas and outline various hurdles international sprinters may face in joining a sprint and how to ensure the international sprinters at the US based sprints feels included. 
- Start with a similar Sprint structure in the Asian Community, e.g., India, but with a small number of attendees initially.
- Motivate local leaders in the Asian Community to be a bridge to increase participation and help build a strong nonprofit ecosystems in their regions supporting Sprint participation.
- Continue to identify challenges faced by international sprinters and enact measures to ensure more participation from them
- Surface considerations to host an International Sprint outside of US
- Draft the survey questions for reaching out to International/Indian Community around participation in a small-sized sprint
- Set the overall expectations and accountability 
- Note societal contexts and privileges awareness for Salesforce.org when planning international centered Sprints
