### History

A group of customers and partners at the October 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint came together to discuss Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Salesforce.org ecosystem. Updates on our discussions and efforts will be posted here.

Q: Why was this being discussed at an Open Source Community Sprint? Aren't those events to improve products and documentation for nonprofit and education organizations?

A: Correct, the primary purpose of an Open Source Community Sprint is to improve products. However, many of us have first-hand knowledge of the magic that ensues when mission-focused Trailblazers connect in person. The value produced beyond product improvement is substantial; notably due to the Salesforce.org Sprint team providing one of the safest and welcoming spaces in the ecosystem. Increasing the participation of historically marginalized Black and other Peoples of Color in the Salesforce.org ecosystem is key to people from these communities gaining sustainable careers, building critical interpersonal relationships, and influencing the product development road map.

### Project Vision

We want to build a Diversity, Equality, Inclusive framework. There was clearly a lack of diversity in the room.

*   Who: People of color who are historically marginalized and are seeking a sustainable career in the Salesforce ecosystem.
*   What: To be invited and on boarded (by Salesforce) into a welcoming space to build deep relationships and navigate the Salesforce ecosystem

### Project Resources (It's ok if you'd prefer to type all the things in Google docs, Quip, or your word processor of choice, just please make sure you include links to your work here in Github. We need a source of truth, and for now that's here in GitHub.)

### Current Project Team Accomplishments
What did the Project Team get done during the Sprint?

### Project Team Accomplishments (YTD)

* We identified our target user then identified potential barriers for that person. We then identified outcomes and possible solutions. We decided that we will first focus on the Atlanta Sprint and based on our successes there build out a larger framework for other sprints and Salesforce events.
* We created a V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles and Measures) here https://docs.google.com/document/d/178h7Iua-MCbgxUCh5s2qCYQjCpOESWhMmXY3O7VhEt0/edit?pli=1
* SFDO Sprint Team (Cori/Jace/Judi) has partnered with Mary Scotton, VP, Trailblazer Equality at Salesforce to act as a consultant for Community Sprint DEI efforts. Mary will be attending the Atlanta Sprint, and will be speaking to her Trailblazer Equality efforts on March 31st.
* Updated https://biggerboat.quip.com/1JBYAPmVQ2Is “Who Attends a Sprint” section based on feedback from Mary. 
* Updated https://biggerboat.quip.com/irl0AkvElRML to include Equality Trailhead Modules to encourage being a better Ally and understanding our own bias based on feedback from Mary. 
* Updated Atlanta Registration (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/salesforceorg-open-source-community-sprint-atlanta-registration-86857542247) to reflect new language based on feedback from Mary. 
* SFDO Sprint Team and Mary are working on an official statement to show that DEI is a priority, to include in docs - WIP
* Working on contracting with an Atlanta restaurant venue for the main Sprint dinner that reflects our commitment to DEI. This is a WIP and all attempts will be made to select a local venue that reflects diversity in Atlanta. Continued efforts will be made for future Seattle and Austin venues during the contract process.
* Emailed invitation to attend the Atlanta Sprint to all NGO and EDU Admins in Georgia, and all surrounding states within an approx. 10 hour drive radius (give or take). 
* Increase the number of POC sprint attendees at the 2020 Sprints.  
* Identify barriers to participation for our target audience. Those in attendance at the Philadelphia Sprint identified some. We'd like know the barriers from those who want to but can not attend. Possible post-Sprint survey in the Hub. 
* Investigating if it would be possible to develop a system to use rental laptops for future Sprints should an attendee request one
* Researching if hosting at least one day of a 2021 Sprint on a weekend would increase diverse registration. How does this impact family time on the weekend vs. balancing work/day care needs during a weekday?

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)

Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br>

* What types of team roles does this project require? This gives you a way to tell future volunteers what kinds of tasks you need help with to complete this project. For example: Do you need a developer, documentation writer, qa tester, thought-leader, general volunteers, etc.

**Atlanta in March!** We need help with connections in Atlanta. As mentioned, our first focus is the Atlanta Sprint. If you have connections in Atlanta, particularly with our target demographic, please reach out to them and personally invite them to the Atlanta Sprint. If you want us to help with the reach out or to follow-up with you please comment in the Power of Us Hub group (see below) or contact one of us directly.

**Austin and Seattle** These are the two other cities that will have Sprints in 2020. We need help in reaching out to our target demographic in these cities. Start early!
