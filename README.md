### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
We want to build a Diversity, Equality, Inclusive framework. There was clearly a lack of diversity in the room.

People of color who are historically marginalized and are seeking a sustainable career in the Salesforce ecosystem.

* What:
To be invited and on boarded (by Salesforce) into a welcoming space to build deep relationships and navigate the Salesforce ecosystem

### Project Team Accomplishments
We identified our target user then identified potential barriers for that person. Wethen identified outcomes and possible solutions. We decided that we will first focus on the Atlanta Sprint and based on our successess there build out a larger framework for other sprints and Salesforce events.

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Our team is continuing to meet to determine next steps. 

**Help Wanted**: We need help with connections in Atlanta. As mentioned, our first focus is the Atlanta Sprint. With that in mind, if you have any connections in Atlanta please update this spreadsheet https://bit.ly/2MqK1KM
