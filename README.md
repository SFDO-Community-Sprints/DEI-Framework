### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Framework

Welcome!

The DEI project is focused on increasing the diversity, equity and inclusion at the Sprints.
This project is for all verticals. Everyone is included!


### Brief History

After noticing a lack of diversity in the room at the 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint, a group of customers and partners formed a project team to address systemic Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion issues within the Salesforce ecosystem/economy. The team set out with the goal to identify, mitigate, and dismantle structural barriers that have barred people from marginalized communities from entry to the Sprint events and the broader Salesforce ecosystem.


### Project Vision

The DEI Team fundamentally believes that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strengthen our community. When the DEI team formed in 2019, we set out to make Sprint events more diverse and inclusive spaces where talented and driven individuals could thrive regardless of socio-economic background. The urgency of the current moment means it’s all of our responsibility to examine all aspects of our personal and professional lives, including here within the Open Source Commons Community.

We understand that our diversity strengthens us. When people can fully be themselves, reflecting individual and collective experiences, backgrounds, characteristics, and influences, we all benefit

### Understanding our current reality and key takeaways
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion work is long term social change work, and it’s first step is understanding what is the current reality and what challenges need our attention now.

During the March 2020 Virtual Sprint, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Sprint Team developed a survey to understand the experiences of those who participated in the Virtual Sprint. The DEI Team has collated the results to make recommendations to the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team on how to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints moving forward.

#### Key Takeaways

1) Black Sprint participants did not feel represented.
2) Once Black participants were engaged in the Sprint, their experience tracked similarly to the whole group: positively.
3) There was a significant lack of participants who identify as LGBTQ+ and non-binary, non-gender confirming.
4) Sprint participants were overwhelmingly white and female with 32% of participants identifying as straight, white women. 

#### Recommendations

Our findings show that the most effective ways to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints are to:

1) Increase the number of diverse participants at the Sprint
2) Equip and empower diverse participants to get the most out of the Sprint.

We commend the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team for the intention and execution of creating a welcoming and inclusive Virtual Sprint, and we look forward to these recommendations being implemented in future Sprints. Thank you!
