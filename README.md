A group of customers and partners at the October 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint came together to discuss Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Salesforce.org ecosystem. Updates on our discussions and efforts will be posted here.

Q: Why was this being discussed at an Open Source Community Sprint? Aren't those events to improve products and documentation for nonprofit and education organizations?

A: Correct, the primary purpose of an Open Source Community Sprint is to improve products. However, many of us have first-hand knowledge of the magic that ensues when mission-focused Trailblazers connect in person. The value produced beyond product improvement is substantial; notably due to the Salesforce.org Sprint team providing one of the safest and welcoming spaces in the ecosystem. Increasing the participation of historically marginalized Black and other Peoples of Color in the Salesforce.org ecosystem is key to people from these communities gaining sustainable careers, building critical interpersonal relationships, and influencing the product development road map.

We created a V2MOM that can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/178h7Iua-MCbgxUCh5s2qCYQjCpOESWhMmXY3O7VhEt0/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/178h7Iua-MCbgxUCh5s2qCYQjCpOESWhMmXY3O7VhEt0/edit#)

**What we need from community at this time**

Please update [this spreadsheet ](https://bit.ly/2MqK1KM)if you have connections in Atlanta. Also please reach out to those connections and encourage them to come to the Atlanta Sprint or help us spread the word particularly with the target demographic.

**Project Vision (Your first task as a team)**

We want to build a Diversity, Equality, Inclusive framework. There was clearly a lack of diversity in the room.



*   Who: People of color who are historically marginalized and are seeking a sustainable career in the Salesforce ecosystem.
*   What: To be invited and on boarded (by Salesforce) into a welcoming space to build deep relationships and navigate the Salesforce ecosystem

### 
**Project Team Accomplishments**

We identified our target user then identified potential barriers for that person. We then identified outcomes and possible solutions. We decided that we will first focus on the Atlanta Sprint and based on our successes there build out a larger framework for other sprints and Salesforce events.


### 
**Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)**

Our team is continuing to meet to determine the next steps.
