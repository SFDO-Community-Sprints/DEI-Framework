### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Framework

Welcome!

The DEI project is focused on increasing the diversity, equity and inclusion at the Sprints and beyond.
This project is for all verticals. Everyone is included!

### Project Vision

Our vision is that Salesforce and community leaders create diverse, equitable, and inclusive spaces. We create community-based, free, and open source tools to identify and remove barriers and empower people from marginalized groups to show up and participate as their full authentic selves.

Our [V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles and Measures)](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DEI-Framework/wiki/DEI-V2MOM) - we are working to update this at the May 2021 sprint

### Brief History

After noticing a lackof diversity in the room at the 2019 Philly Open Source Community Sprint, a group of customers and partners formed a project team to address systemic Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion issues within the Salesforce ecosystem/economy. The team set out with the goal to identify, mitigate, and dismantle structural barriers that have barred people from marginalized communities from entry to the Sprint events and the broader Salesforce ecosystem.

### Current Priorities

* Gather participant data
* Create a welcoming, safe and effective space
* Minimize barriers to participation
* Conduct inclusive marketing and outreach to raise awareness of the Sprints among under-represented groups
* Provide Salesforce with resources and recommendations to improve commitment to community DEI

### Understanding our current reality and key takeaways

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion work is long term social change work, and it’s first step is understanding what is the current reality and what challenges need our attention now.

During the March 2020 Virtual Sprint, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Sprint Team developed a survey to understand the experiences of those who participated in the Virtual Sprint. The DEI Team has collated the results to make recommendations to the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team on how to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints moving forward. 

[Analysis of Results of March 2020 Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DHMRS7ZV90G5Y544aPm8NyQvjsZyM1Q6/view)

#### Key Takeaways

1) Black Sprint participants did not feel represented.
2) Once Black participants were engaged in the Sprint, their experience tracked similarly to the whole group: positively.
3) There was a significant lack of participants who identify as LGBTQ+ and non-binary, non-gender confirming.
4) Sprint participants were overwhelmingly white and female with 32% of participants identifying as straight, white women. 

#### Recommendations

Our findings show that the most effective ways to increase diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in Sprints are to:

1) Increase the number of diverse participants at the Sprint
2) Equip and empower diverse participants to get the most out of the Sprint.

We commend the Salesforce.org Open Source Commons Team for the intention and execution of creating a welcoming and inclusive Virtual Sprint, and we look forward to these recommendations being implemented in future Sprints. Thank you!
